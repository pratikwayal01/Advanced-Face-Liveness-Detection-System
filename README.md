*A modern solution for secure face verification using hybrid detection techniques.*

## Overview
This project develops an **Advanced Face Liveness Detection System** that ensures secure and accurate face verification by combining **hybrid detection** techniques. The system integrates **active liveness detection** through AI-generated random action prompts and **passive methods** like facial texture and depth analysis to prevent spoofing attacks (e.g., photos or videos).

## Features 🚀
- 🧠 **Hybrid Detection**: Combines active (user interaction) and passive (facial texture, depth) methods for enhanced liveness detection.
- 🤖 **AI-Generated Prompts**: Dynamically generates random action prompts (e.g., blinking, head tilts) based on facial analysis, making it difficult to spoof.
- 🖼️ **Passive Liveness Detection**: Utilizes advanced facial texture, depth, and motion analysis to detect any spoofing attempts using photos or videos.

## Technologies 🛠️
- ![OpenCV Logo](https://opencv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/OpenCV_logo_black-2.png) **OpenCV**: For real-time facial recognition and image processing.
- ![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png) **Python**: Core programming language.
- 🧬 **Deep Learning**: For facial texture and depth detection.
- 🎯 **AI Prompt Generation**: Uses AI to personalize action prompts for users.

## Future Improvements 🌱
- ⚡ **Improve AI models** for faster and more accurate prompt generation.
- 🌐 **Expand passive detection methods** with 3D depth sensing and additional techniques.
- 📱 **Implement mobile-friendly** versions of the system for wide accessibility.
